This is a basic lexical analyzer part of a compiler. It can separate keywords, identifiers, special characters, numbers, logical operator and math operators 
from a input C code to create a symbol table.

***** This does not work with functions in the C code. *****

Put the C language code in the input.txt file, make a lexical analyzer object passing the file path of input.txt and run the compute_symbol_table method.
Print the object to see the symbol table.
